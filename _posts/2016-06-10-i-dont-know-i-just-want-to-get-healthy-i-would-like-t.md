THE 42

I am in my Jackie Robinson year. 42\. The lessening metabolism, the eroding hairline, the increased distance between eye and hand necessary to view my phone: The indicators of midlife are beginning to show. When I read the news online embedded on the pages are advertisements for fat-blasters, testosterone replacement, and that product promoted by an old bald guy whose head looks to be transplanted on another guy's tan, muscular, shirtless (and thankfully not jean-less) body. (I must admit I am tempted to know what _Cenegenics_ can do for me and whether there is alien technology involved.) I don't know what Google search spawned these targeted ads but perhaps it is time to delete my cookies.

I do not feel 42\. I feel like mid-thirties, tops. Maybe late-twenties if I get a in a good stretch in the morning. But I suspect that if time-travel was in fact a possibility and I traversed the continuum and arrived in 2002 to meet then-me, 28 me would look at 42 me and ask, "Who's the _old_ guy?"

I know this to be true because my mother recently posted a photograph of 28 me and I asked, "Who's the _young_ guy?" The photo was taken on my honeymoon at a cooking class in Chiang Mai. Thick hair, lean physique, white smile, healthy mocha pallor: It was hard to believe that I looked like that while I was sick with an influenza and hopped up on a Thai decongestant that burned my nostrils like wasabi. Stated alternatively, I looked better _sick_ at 28 than I do healthy at 42\. This is humbling.

At 42 though I am supposed to be endowed with a wisdom and self-awareness one gains only through the sometimes bumpy sometimes constricting passage of time. Insight and introspection must _surely_ be superior to the misplaced and often displaced energies of youth. I can now enroll in classes that utilize paleolithic movements, buy organic fruits and vegetables to be pureed into an antioxidant smoothie each morning, procure an entire wardrobe of form fitting moisture wicking apparel to make my exercising pleasant and smile-inducing. As a 42 year old adult I can _do_ better than a 28 year old man-child. Right?

But "adulting" as Internet memes intimate is hard and 42 me wonders if he has the courage, fortitude and _grit_ (such an "it" word right now) to face down the 42\. It's time to find out.
